    # the given web socket and returns it. Additionally, the given web socket is
    # associated with its contained client id so that the web socket can be accessed
    # via the client_id.

    # Since web sockets are not session aware and therefore can change over time

    # for this resp. client.

    # requesting client and false is returned. Further processing of the request is
    # ignored.

    # same client_id) an error is sent back to the requesting client and false is
    # returned. Further processing of the request is ignored.
